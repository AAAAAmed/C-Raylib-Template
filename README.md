# C Raylib Template
A little raylib template, it handles rendering at a small resolution and upscaling the image, and keeping the aspect ratio consistent.

The build scripts are for Linux, not Windows.

`build` requirements:
- gcc

`buildWindows` requirements:
- mingw-w64-gcc

The resulting executable files are statically linked, they don't rely on any uncommon dynamic dependencies.
